# Caribbean_ROV

Caribbean ROV was designed as a part of University project to help to do several tasks as investigation of shipwrecks & do 
several tasks relevant to this issue, investigation of oil pipelines underwater & fix some parts of it, monitoring under 
water life as fish and corals exploring submerged monuments & carry small parts of it. 

Our ROV is made of PVC tubes connected together. It contains one well isolated tube including all our electrical system 
(Data transmission, Data processing, Motor driving system). Our ROV is equipped with 4 thrusters in different directions to 
enable the ROV to move in all direction with good maneuvering. 

The ROV also has a Camera equipped with night vision system in addition to high intensity light torch. The ROV is operated 
by normal Lead Acid Battery (12V - 12Ah). The pilot controls the ROV with a joystick, which is a part of our Driving station, 
which also include a screen viewing the camera. Two Arduinos are controlling the ROV form inside and outside to interface with 
a screen.  The details of each code are attached with the project.
